## How it works
 
The Login with Amazon button is implemented on all login and registration forms on your website (including a free popup login form) as soon as you enable it and configure the Magento 2 Amazon integration. This button will redirect customers to the Amazon authentication page in a popup, where they need to provide the login credentials for their Amazon accounts. Once complete, users are signed in and can quickly make purchases on your website.
 
Besides the Amazon Login option, the extension provides the following features:

* The extension automatically captures a user's email address, gender, birth date, and profile photo – then adds that user to your database as a new customer. Use this data to improve your marketing efforts through newsletter campaigns, targeted promotions, and more.
* This plugin pulls the user's profile image from their Amazon account and displays it next to the User Account menu or anywhere else on your website. This helps you personalize the user experience by making the page more familiar to the customer. 
* Сustomers can conveniently share products they like with friends, increasing your social traffic and sales.
* Millions of customers can use Amazon sign-in button to quickly and securely authenticate to your website even on the checkout page. This way you will reduce the cart abandonment rates and increase sales!
